# TrueMeteo

If you want to know what is currently happening in your city with the weather and air quality, you need to use this app. You can find your city by coordinates or by name in the search, find out the current parameters and forecast for 16 days, and you can also view the hourly weather forecast for any of these days. The same applies to air quality, but the forecast is provided for a maximum of 5 days. There is also a page with climate news that covers climate change and so on. I also added an admin panel to be able to add, delete or edit news or scrape them from third-party sites.
Weather data provided from the open-meteo.com project API.
